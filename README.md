**Caution**

Downloading and setting up odoo-easymanage-full repository requires more computer and internet resources, needs to allocate higher memory sizes for heap/etc. Its better to set it up on large server computer.

Rather than running *full* projects, copy table-related folders/files to *sample* project and run.
